# Titanic Survival Prediction and Machine Learning Pipeline

This project provides a complete data analysis and machine learning case study using the Titanic dataset. It includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and predictive modelling in Python. The goal is to understand survival patterns, identify the factors that influenced survival and build a clear, reproducible workflow for predicting passenger outcomes.

## Objective

The main goals of this project are:
- To analyse how different passenger attributes affected survival
- To identify patterns across age, gender, class and family size
- To explore the Titanic dataset through a clean and structured analysis
- To build a machine learning workflow to predict passenger survival
- To showcase an end-to-end analytical project suitable for portfolios


## Dataset Overview

The dataset is available on Kaggle:  
[**Titanic Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

It contains important passenger details, including:
- PassengerId  
- Survived  
- Pclass  
- Name, Sex, Age  
- SibSp, Parch  
- Ticket, Fare  
- Cabin  
- Embarked  

These features help explore demographic patterns and build survival prediction models.


## Tools Used
- Python for data cleaning, analysis and modelling  
- Jupyter Notebook for documenting and running the project  
- pandas and numpy for dataset manipulation  
- seaborn and matplotlib for visualisations  
- scikit-learn for preprocessing, encoding, model training and pipeline creation  


## Project Workflow

### Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (titanic_analysis.ipynb)
- Loaded and inspected the dataset  
- Cleaned missing values and prepared the data  
- Explored survival trends through visualisations  
- Analysed the impact of gender, age and class on survival  
- Identified useful relationships between different variables  
- Built and tested baseline machine learning models for comparison  

### Phase 2: Machine Learning Pipeline (titanic_pipeline.ipynb)
- Created a structured pipeline for preprocessing and modelling  
- Applied encoding to categorical variables  
- Scaled and transformed features where required  
- Trained a classification model to predict survival  
- Evaluated performance using accuracy and other metrics  
- Designed the notebook so that the entire pipeline runs in one go  


## Business and Analytical Value

This project demonstrates how data analysis and modelling can:
- Reveal the most influential factors in predicting outcomes  
- Improve decision-making through visual insights  
- Highlight the importance of preprocessing for better model accuracy  
- Provide a streamlined pipeline that produces consistent and reproducible results  
- Showcase real-world analytical and modelling skills in a clean, structured format
